Aim:

To implement First-come First- serve(FCFS) scheduling technique

Algorithm:

1. Get the number of processes from the user.
2. Read the process name and burst time.
3. Calculate the total process time.
4. Calculate the total waiting time and total turnaround time for each process
5. Display the process name & burst time for each process.
6. Display the total waiting time, average waiting time, turnaround time
