Aim:

To write a C program to catch signals used in Linux.

Algorithm:

1. The program is initialized for catching interrupt signal(SIGINT).
2. If Cntrl+C is pressed within 3 seconds then my_handler is called
3. my_handler routine displays the signal that was caught.
4. If no interrupt received then PART-II is executed.
5. In PART-II,Cntrl+C is ignored till 3 seconds then it goes to PART-III.
6. In PART-III, the default action takes place.
