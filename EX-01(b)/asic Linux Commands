The ‘Metacharacters of unix’ command:

Metacharacters are special characters that are at higher and abstract level compared to

special way.

EXAMPLE:

* - Specifies number of characters
?- Specifies a single character
[ ]- used to match a whole set of file names at a command line.
! – Used to Specify

16
an be divided into thr
r-read
w-write
x-execute

$ ls r** - Displays all the files whose name begins with ‘r’

$ ls ?kkk - Displays the files which are having ‘kkk’, from the second characters

irrespective of the first character.

Next three bits Group to which owner of the file belongs
Last three bits Others

EXAMPLE: $ ls college
-rwxr-xr-- 1 Lak std 1525 jan10 12:10 college
Where,
-rwx The file is readable, writable and executable by the owner of the file.
Lak Specifies Owner of the file.
r-x Indicates the absence of the write permission by the Group owner of the file.
Std Is the Group Owner of the file.
r-- Indicates read permissions for others.


12. The ‘chmod’ command:
The chmod command is used to set the read, write and execute permissions for all
categories of users for file.

SYNTAX: $ chmod category operation permission file

Category Operation permission
u-users + assign r-read
g-group -Remove w-write
o-others = assign absolutely x-execute
a-all

EXAMPLE:
$ chmod u –wx college
Removes write & execute permission for users for ‘college’ file.
$ chmod u +rw, g+rw college

Assigns all permission to the owner, read and write permissions to the group and only
executable permission to the others for ‘college’ file.


1.4 GROUPING COMMANDS
