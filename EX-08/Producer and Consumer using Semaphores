Aim:

To write a program to implement solution to producer consumer problem using
semaphores.

Algorithm:

1. Initialize semaphore empty, full and mutex.
2. Create two threads- producer thread and consumer thread.
3. Wait for target thread termination.
4. Call sem_wait on empty semaphore followed by mutex semaphore
before entry into criticalsection.
5. Produce/Consumer the item in critical section.
6. Call sem_post on mutex semaphore followed by full semaphore
before exiting critical section.
7. Allow the otherthread to enter its criticalsection.
8. Terminate after looping ten times in producer and consumer threads each.
