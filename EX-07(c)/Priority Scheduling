Aim:

To implement priority scheduling technique

Algorithm:

1. Get the number of processes from the user.
2. Read the process name, burst time and priority of process.
3. Sort based on burst time of all processes in ascending order based priority
4. Calculate the total waiting time and total turnaround time for each process
5. Display the process name & burst time for each process.
6. Display the total waiting time, average waiting time, turnaround time
